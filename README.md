# Net practice

This PDF is a concept document for the Ecole 42 Net Practice Project. The project includes a series of challenging tasks that cover topics such as network programming, TCP/IP, UNIX sockets, I/O multiplexing, databases, SSL/TLS, and web programming. The goal of the project is to provide students with a deep understanding of network programming.

The project is divided into different stages. The first stage is to write a simple HTTP server and bind it to a specific URL. The second stage is to make the server application multi-threaded and able to process multiple requests at the same time. The third stage is to add SSL/TLS support on the server side. The fourth stage is to write a simple HTTP client. The fifth stage is to create a basic web application.

Each stage of the project focuses on learning and implementing specific skills. Students are required to complete specific tasks to ensure understanding and deepening of the topics. In addition, students must test their code for possible errors and fix them.

This project is suitable for students who want to gain an advanced experience in network programming. The project will help students develop their network programming skills and gain valuable skills that they can use in real-world applications.
